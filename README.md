1️⃣ Responsive Webpage Development
I built a simple yet fully responsive webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The design adapts seamlessly across different screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. Media queries were used to ensure a smooth user experience across all devices.

2️⃣ User Authentication Form
For this task, I created a login form with client-side validation. The form includes:
✅ Email validation to ensure the correct format using regex.
✅ Password validation with a minimum length requirement.
✅ User authentication mechanism that allows users to log in and be added to the application after successful authentication.

3️⃣ Single-Page Application (SPA) with Data Fetching
I developed a React-based SPA that fetches and displays data from an external API. Key highlights:
🔹 Built using React to ensure smooth UI updates and navigation.
🔹 Implemented API integration to fetch dynamic data and display it in real-time.
🔹 Used React state management for handling data updates efficiently.

4️⃣ Todo Application Development
I built a responsive Todo App that allows users to manage their daily tasks effectively. Features include:
📌 Add, edit, and delete tasks.
📌 Persistent data storage using an API.
📌 A clean and modern UI that works seamlessly across all devices.
